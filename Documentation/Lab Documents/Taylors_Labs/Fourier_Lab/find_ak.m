% This function finds the Fourier
% Series coefficients
% T is the Period
% Computes the fourier coefficients
% x is the sampled funciton 
% k is the coeeficient number
% fs is the sample rate
function f = find_ak(x, k, fs)

% The sample time Ts is 1/sampleRate

% The period T is (# of samples)*

% w0 = (2*pi)/T;
